# Recommender-Engines
### What are Recommendation Systems?
Recommendation systems help users discover items they might like by analyzing data about users, products, and their interactions (e.g., ratings or purchases). These systems provide personalized suggestions, improving user experiences and engagement.

### About the Project
This project uses the Amazon Beauty Products Ratings dataset from Kaggle to build a recommender system for suggesting beauty products to customers. The dataset contains over 2 million customer ratings for beauty-related products sold on Amazon, including:

UserId: Unique identifier for each customer
ProductId: Amazon's unique identification code for each product
Ratings: Customer satisfaction ratings ranging from 1 to 5
Timestamp: UNIX timestamp of when the rating was provided
Recommender Systems in this Project
We implemented three recommendation engines to cater to different user needs:

1. **Popularity-Based Recommender System**
Designed for new customers without prior purchasing history, this system suggests the top 10 bestselling products.
Recommendations are generated by analyzing the most-rated products, factoring in their average ratings to ensure quality suggestions.
This approach mimics "Best Seller" tags often seen on e-commerce platforms.

3. **Model-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommender System**
Aimed at returning customers, this system uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user preferences.
SVD analyzes patterns in customer ratings to predict how much a user might like products they havenâ€™t rated yet.
For example, if User A and User B both liked Product X, and User A also liked Product Y, the model might recommend Product Y to User B.

3. **Self-Attention Transformer-Based Recommender System**
This system leverages deep learning techniques to enhance recommendations by analyzing customer behavior.
A self-attention mechanism captures relationships between products rated by a user, identifying patterns and preferences.
It provides more nuanced and personalized product suggestions by learning subtle product similarities.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, surprise, and other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
### Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommender-engines.git
cd recommender-engines
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Kaggle: Amazon Ratings Dataset.

Sign in to Kaggle and download the ratings_Beauty.csv file.
Place the dataset in the data directory of the repository.
Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the dataset and build recommendation engines.
Customize the code to input user IDs and generate personalized recommendations.
Results
Popularity-Based Recommender: Generates top-rated products for new users with no purchase history.
Collaborative Filtering: Predicts user preferences and suggests products based on similar users or items.
Self-Attention Transformer: Leverages deep learning to identify product relationships and improve recommendations.
